## The `plugins` directory

Unfortunately we cannot make TreeRoute 100% open-source as we use the HERE SDK for mapping, but we are not allowed to publish this. As a result, in order to compile TreeRoute, you must download the SDK from their platform: <https://platform.here.com/> and use your own API key.
